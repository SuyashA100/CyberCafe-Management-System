# CyberCafe-Management-System
We are going to  Build a Cybercafe Management System using Java and we will also integrate Databases in it.


Important Points
> We are using The Xampp's myphpadmin for The Database.
> We Have to Add The Connector-j Dependency.

Important Steps 
-> Change The "Your Database's URL" string in the code with your Database's Actual URL.
-> Extract The mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.zip file.
-> It Will Produce The Folder mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.
-> In That Folder There will be a Executable Jar File Named as mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.
-> Add That Jar File in The Deppendencies.
